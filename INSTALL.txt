Author: Richard Laffers

*** INSTALLATION ***

1. Download & extract the OpenChemBase package.

2. Install the SQL tables by importing `openchembase/install/install.sql` into your MySQL database.

2. Edit `config.inc.php` and fill in your MySQL database credentials.

	
3.  
Implement OpenChemBase in your pages. You've got two options:

a) Use the included examples 

	or

b) include the inventory system within your web pages. Typically, you need to add:
	
		<link href='openchembase/theme/style.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' />
	
	to the <head> section of your pages, and :
		
		<?php
			require("openchembase/OpenChemBase.class.php");
			$openchembase->display();  // this provides listing of all chemicals in the database
		?>
	
	within the <body> section to display some output. You must stick with the same file names as shown in the examples.
